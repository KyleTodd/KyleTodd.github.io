                             <p>I have had quite a bit of experience creating websites in the past including inside and outside school.
                               I initially started my programming journery by making basic websites for school assignments with HTML and CSS but moved
                               on to larger projects that took advantage of PHP, JavaScript and MYSQL databases for work. After that I learned python to automate
                               repetitive functions and use my Raspberry Pi to create a weather station. I am currently leaning Java in the subject programming
                               fundamentals.
